Woolang（原名 RestorableScene）是第四代 scene 系列语言，拥有静态类型系统，性能也相对不错（在脚本语言中比较而言）。

Woolang (origin name is RestorableScene) is fourth generation of my 'scene' programing language. It has a static type system and good performance (compared to other scripting languages).

```rust
import woo.std;
func main()
{
    std::println("Helloworld, woo~");
}
```
